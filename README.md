## Abstract: 
Oligotrophic South Adriatic Sea is characterized by nutrient limitation and prevailing mixo-heterotrophic-parasitic protist community over primary producers. During stratification periods, physical forcings such as internal-trapped waves (abb. ITWs) can provide essential nutrient fluxes to surface layers and influence the fine-scale changes in microbial communities. During a two-week in situ experiment we approached the water-column community diversity estimation with environmental metabarcoding of plankton during and after ITW event. Both, bacteria and eukaryotes confirmed significant dissimilarities between size-fraction and depths, with ITW event significantly contributing in eukaryotic communitiy clustering. Major bacterial contributors were Gammaproteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidota and Verrucomicrobiota having major contributions within samples after ITW event. Bacterial functional profiling recovered ureolysis, aerobic ammonia oxidation, nitrification and ectoparasitic or predatory roles to be directly linked to shifting environmental parameters within the water column. Metazoan sequences (mainly Arthropoda, class Copepoda) dominated micro fraction, while various dinoflagellates (with high contribution of parasitic Syndiniales) dominated nano and pico size fractions. Primary production relied mostly on Mamiellophyceae, Prymnesiophyceae and Bacillariophaceae, having highest relative abundances within DCM. Co-occurence genus-level networks in surface and DCM revealed about 34% and 39%, respectively, attributable to putative trophic interactions with protists dominating over zooplankton taxa in both communities. Important network taxa connectors were identified belonging to autotrophic protists and one zooplankton taxa within DCM, while in surface network connectors number generally decreased, omitting zooplankton.
