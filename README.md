## Abstract: 
Oligotrophic southern Adriatic Sea is characterized by nutrient limitation, physical forcings such as internal-trapped waves (Lastovo Island) and mixotrophic – heterotrophic and parasite protist community prevailing over primary producers. Disentangling dynamic food webs within surface and DCM communities in such environments is challenging and can allow us to understand microecology of the area. This study aimed to investigate prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbiota through metabarcoding approach and to analyse their response to environmental variables (temperature, salinity, nutrients, physical forcing (internal trapped waves - ITWs)) through three size fractions and two depths.
